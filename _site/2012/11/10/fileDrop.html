<p>Have you ever used FTP before? How&#8217;d you do it? Filezilla? Your browser? Some other crappy FTP client? Doesn&#8217;t matter - one way or another, I would bet money that the experience sucked. <strong>No one likes FTP.</strong></p>

<p>fileDrop was built to ease the pain for businesses that require an easy method to move files back and forth. First and foremost, fileDrop&#8217;s interface <strong>just makes sense</strong>. On top of that we&#8217;ve got quick uploads and downloads, secure transfers, easy management, intelligent notifications, popup previews, and tons of configurations for all you overbearing sys admins. Don&#8217;t make your clients deal with your crappy FTP system - give fileDrop a try.</p>
