<p>I&#8217;m a pretty big believer that less is more when it comes to web servers - that&#8217;s why I started using Node.js in the first place! So, while there&#8217;s plenty of great Node.js web servers out there, I would (almost) always recommend starting from scratch, and adding features as you need them. That&#8217;s why I built node-session - it&#8217;s a great tool for the barebones Node.js web server, which will allow you to store user sessions. And the code is simple, to boot!</p>

<pre><code>var session = require(&#39;./node-session.js&#39;);

//Start your http server however you like. Imagine the code below is inside of your server loop

var yourSession = session.start(response, request); //response and request are the res/req variables passed from http.createServer()

yourSession.testValue = &quot;A session variable&quot; //Create a session variable called testValue</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s it! And at just 3KB for the entire repository, node-session is the perfect no-bloat solution for your Node.js web server!</p>
