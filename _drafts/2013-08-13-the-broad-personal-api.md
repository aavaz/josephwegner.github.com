The [founder of Foursquare](NEED URL) wrote an article a few weeks ago about [a personal API](NEED URL).  The idea was essentially that you would collect all of your personal "human" data into one location, and then be able to do analytics that.  In his current implementation he's grabbing data from Nike Fuel, Fitbit (NEED MORE) and condensing this all into a single [read API](NEED URL).

I wouldn't necessarily call myself a "lifehacker" - I don't currently collect any data on myself, and I don't spend a lot of time thinking about how I can modify my routine to enhance my health/happiness/wealth/etc.  I do, however, recognize what a wealth this data could be.  On top of Naveen's basic idea of "Human" data (steps, books read, weight), I think there would be plenty of value in plugging into technical services that are already tracking us (Twitter, Foursquare, Github).  Applications I can see in my personal life:

1. I go back and forth between walking and biking to the train in the morning.  It would be incredibly interesting to see how my stress levels (sweat, pulse, body temperature) relate to how I get to the train.
2. Some days I drink an Americano in the morning.  I would like to see how my productivity changes with or without the caffeine (trackable, because we do time estimates and tracking per task).
3. There are certain positive actions that I would like to do more often in my life (call my mother, run, contribute to open source software).  This API would let me see what trends lead up to the positive actions.  Interesting factors might include weather, diet, stress levels during work, sleep.

So those things are all well and good, but they're not really that important.  It's probably better for me to bike to work, because it's better excercise.  I probably shouldn't drink the coffee in the morning, because productivity will drop after the temporary caffeine high.  I probably call my mother more often when it's sunny, I had a good day at work, and my wife just made me eat a banana.  While most of these data points are _interesting_, the conclusions we make from them are usually going to be _obvious_.

The implications of this API are greater than figuring out what coffee you should drink, though.  If the data can be reliably anonymized, it could easily be aggregated to broader scopes than a single person.  Imagine if we were able to collect all of this data and analyze it at a neighborhood or city level.  Think about these scenarios:

1. They recently started doing road construction in your community.  For the duration of the construction, the average amount of sleep per night decreased by 5%.  This data will feed into future decisions on when and how to do construction projects.
2. Your town recently increased the fines for littering.  Outdoor physical activity (running, biking) has increased by 10%.
